# HOUSE_PRICE_PREDICTION
House Price Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to estimate the selling price of a house based on various features. The goal is to build a model that learns the relationship between house characteristics and their market prices so that it can accurately predict prices for new, unseen properties.
